Given the following class:

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

complete the function

which compares the two trees defined by TreeNodes a and b and returns true if they are equal in structure and in value and false otherwise.
